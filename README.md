# Notion Math

Notion Math is a chrome extension that uses MathQuill editors and katex to insert equations into Notion inline and block equations without knowing latex code. The MathQuill textbox autocompletes some of the latex rendering for you, making it easier to enter in equations into the textbox.

## Installing

Notion Math is not on the Chrome Web Store, so in order to use it you will need to follow a few steps below:
1. Download the zip file and unzip it
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions
3. Turn on "Developer mode" in the top right corner of the page
4. Click the "Load Unpacked" button in the top left corner
5. Select the unzipped folder and you're good to go!

## Usage

Create equations by typing in latex directly or by browsing and selecting math characters from the math buttons provided. Click insert equation to insert it at the cursor. If you are using Inline or Block equations in Notion, you can first create the block and then use the extension to insert the equation into the text box that Notion provides.
